# Cubesat Basics:
## Introduction to CUBESAT : Basic concepts and processes
 - What is a cubesat?

   A CubeSat is a class of small satellite with a form factor of 10 cm (3.9 in) cubes. These tiny satellites have a 
   mass of no more than 2 kg (4.4 lb) per unit and often use commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components for their 
   electronics and structure. CubeSats are deployed into orbit from the International Space Station or launched as 
   secondary payloads on a launch vehicle. They‚Äôre employed for various purposes, including Earth observation, 
   testing new communications technology, and performing miniature experiments
  
- Why CUBESAT?
  
   CubeSats began as a collaborative effort in 1999 between Jordi Puig-Suari, a professor at California Polytechnic 
   State University (Cal Poly), and Bob Twiggs, a professor at Stanford University‚Äôs Space Systems Development 
   Laboratory (SSDL). The original intent of the project was to provide affordable access to space for the university science community, and it has successfully done so. Now these are also used for various other experiments like testing instruments, enabling commercial applications,disaster response to climate monitoring.Supporting advanced mission concepts using constellations or swarms.

# Signal Processing
 ## Digital Modulation 
 - Basic digital modulation:
    1. What is digital modulation? 
    Modulation is The process of superimposing high-frequency carrier signals with low-frequency message signals resulting in a modulated wave.  In modulation, one of the three parameters of the carrier wave is changed i.e. amplitude, frequency or phase according to the amplitude of the message signal at a given time instant. It is an important technique used to increase the range of communication, increase the signal-to-noise ratio, and decrease the size of the antenna. In this process the binary data is modulated to a carrier sinusoidal wave.

2. What are the basic digital modulation methods?
   i. Non-return to zero level:
    It represents binary 1 as a high voltage level (often positive) and binary 0 as a low voltage level (often zero). It maintains the signal level constant for the duration of the bit time.
 ![NZR](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/845994e8-62b9-4a41-8d7c-c185830c4851)
   ii. Unipolar RZ:
   It represents binary 1 as a positive voltage (e.g., +V volts) and binary 0 represented by a zero voltage (0 volts). Return to zero- The signal returns to zero volts (or a reference voltage) at regular intervals, specifically at the midpoint of each bit period.
   ![Unipolar rz](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7f905a06-b4e3-4b02-9a18-d75628d51178)

   iii. Bi-phase-L (Manchester):
    There is a transition in the middle of each bit period, which allows for clock synchronization and improves reliability in noisy environments.Binary 1is represented by a transition from a high to a low (or low to high) state in the middle of the bit period.Binary 0 
 is represented by a transition from a low to a high (or high to low) state in the middle of the bit period.

- Basic Bandpass Modulation
  1.
 2.What are the basic bandpass types? 
  i. Amplitude Shift Keying (ASK):
  Varies the amplitude of the carrier wave to represent binary data.
Binary 1 might be a high amplitude, while binary 0 might be a low or zero amplitude.

 ii. Frequency Shift Keying (FSK):
 Changes the frequency of the carrier wave to represent binary data.
Binary 1 could be a high frequency, and binary 0 could be a low frequency.

iii. Phase Shift Keying (PSK):
Alters the phase of the carrier wave to represent binary data.
Binary 1 and binary 0 are represented by different phase shifts (e.g. 0¬∞and 180¬∞ for Binary PSK).

- Carrier frequency selection
        In telecommunications, carrier frequency refers to the frequency of a carrier wave‚Äîa periodic waveform, usually sinusoidal‚Äîthat carries no information itself. Instead, it‚Äôs modified by an information-bearing signal (the modulation signal) to convey information. The carrier wave typically has a much higher frequency than the message signal. This is done to ensure propagation efficiency. The factors of selecting the carrier frequency are: Power efficiency, bandwidth efficieny, system complexity, frequency allocation and regulations.


# Cubesat communication:
## Satellite orbital Fundamentals
  Upon launch, a satellite or spacecraft is most often placed in one of several particular orbits around Earth ‚Äì or it might be sent on an interplanetary journey, meaning that it does not orbit Earth anymore, but instead orbits the Sun until its arrival at its final destination. They are of the following types : LEO (Low Earth Orbit), MEO(Medium Earth Orbit), GEO(Geostationary Orbit). Here are is the information you need to know before selecting the orbit: [ESA-TYPES OF ORBITS](https://www.esa.int/Enabling_Support/Space_Transportation/Types_of_orbits)

 ## Minimum payload
   -  The payload of a satellite refers to the part that gives it its primary function or purpose. Essentially, the payload is what performs the specific tasks or functions desired from the satellite. For instance, in communication satellites, the payload includes antennas, receivers, and transmitters that facilitates communication.Given below is the minimal payload for a Cubesat.
      
   ![minimumpayload](https://github.com/AshritaSahoo/SIT-CUBESAT-AS/assets/174847576/3ebc7d27-b1f6-412e-ae19-192caabe2b92)

## CubeSat Architecture

![Cubesat architecture](https://github.com/AshritaSahoo/SIT-CUBESAT-AS/assets/174847576/4f5c2992-2749-4cb4-93ea-7d2e4c85b45a)

 ## LoRa based communication system

 - LoRa (from "long range") is a physical proprietary radio communication technique. It is based on spread spectrum modulation techniques derived from chirp spread 
   spectrum (CSS) technology. It was developed by Cycleo, a company of Grenoble, France, and patented in 2014. Cycleo was later acquired by Semtech.
 -  Here is a brief information about LoRa provided by Semtech.[PDF](https://github.com/silicon-sat/SI-2024-CubeSat/blob/main/docs/AN1200_22_Semtech_LoRa_Basics_v2_STD.pdf)

![lora_archtct](https://github.com/AshritaSahoo/SIT-CUBESAT-AS/assets/174847576/c50f5b96-2edc-4804-ac7b-1214b8ddda79)

5. **Power Management:**
   - **DC-DC Converter:** Regulates voltage levels.
   - **LDO (Low Dropout Regulator):** Provides stable power supply.

6. **SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface):**
   - Used for communication between microcontrollers and other devices.

7. **Data Buffer:**
   - Temporarily stores data during processing or transmission.

## ESP32
- The ESP32 is a versatile System on Chip (SoC) microcontroller developed by Espressif Systems. [ESP32 REFERENCE MANUAL](https://github.com/silicon-sat/SI-2024-CubeSat/blob/main/docs/Datasheet-ESP32.pdf)
- [ESP32 DATASHEET](https://github.com/silicon-sat/SI-2024-CubeSat/blob/main/docs/Datasheet-ESP32.pdf)
-  It is a microcontroller, with built-in wifi and bluetooth, it features a dual-core processor, extensive GPIO (General-Purpose Input/Output) pins, and support for various peripherals.
-  These are also widely used in IoT applications.
-   The ESP32's versatility is enhanced by its compatibility with popular development environments like the Arduino IDE and Espressif's own ESP-IDF. In this program, further on, we use the Arduino IDE for various experiments on ESP32.
  
![ESP32](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bcd8925d-297e-4101-a7ee-f9ba505d663d)

  ## SPI protocol (Serial Peripheral Interface)
  - It is a synchronous communication protocol. SPI is a fast, efficient protocol for communication between a master device and multiple slaves, commonly used in microcontroller-based projects for interfacing with peripherals like sensors, displays, and memory devices. Understanding SPI is crucial for developing embedded systems that require reliable, high-speed data transfer.
  - It allows a full duplex communication: i.e it can transmit and receive signals at the same time.
  -  SPI uses four wires:
     MOSI (Master Out, Slave In): Main (master) sends data to the sub (slave).
     MISO (Master In, Slave Out): Sub sends data to the main.
     SCLK (Serial Clock): Clock signal from the main.
     CS (Chip Select): Active-low signal to select a specific sub device.
 - Every device connected requires a wire of its own.
 - Working od SPI:
   Initialization: The master configures the clock speed and selects the slave by pulling the Chip Select line low.
   Data Transfer: Data is shifted out of the master to the slave via MOSI, while data from the slave is shifted into the master via MISO, synchronized by the clock.
   End Communication: The master deselects the slave by pulling the Chip Select line high.  

## Communication process
 - All those devices come together to form a communication system between the satellite(CubeSat) and the ground station consisting of the LoRa module and ESP32.

- The CubeSat collects data (telemetry or payload) and prepares it for transmission. Then its on board computer sends/ transmits data and communicates wirelessly with the LoRa RF module.The frequemcy at which the CubeSat sends the signal is 433MHz and so the ground station is designed in accordance with that to receive the signals, with a coverage of 110 degrees.
- The ESP32 Dev kit is connected to the LoRa RF module via SPI and uploads the data to the internet with WiFi.
- This data can be extracted from the Tiny GS website which is an open-source global satellite network that empowers space enthusiasts to become pioneers.
