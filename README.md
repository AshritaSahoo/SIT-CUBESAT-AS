# 🗣️ AN ENLIGHTENING TALK BY Dr. Chinmoy Saha 
 - He is a Professor at the Department of Avionics in the Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology.
 - His Talk was about Small form factor satellites and satellite communication.
 - A CubeSat is a class of small satellite with a form factor of 10 cm (3.9 in) cubes. These tiny satellites have a 
   mass of no more than 2 kg (4.4 lb) per unit and often use commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components for their 
   electronics and structure. CubeSats are deployed into orbit from the International Space Station or launched as 
   secondary payloads on a launch vehicle. They’re employed for various purposes, including Earth observation, 
   testing new communications technology, and performing miniature experiments

- He is a core team member of To Space.
- His talk about Exploring pocket cube satellites gave off small satellites, big impact vibes.
- A PocketCube is a type of miniaturized satellite designed for space research. These tiny satellites typically have 
  a cube shape with 5 cm sides (one-eighth the volume of a CubeSat) and weigh no more than 250 grams. They often    
  use commercial off-the-shelf components for their electronics. Despite their small size, PocketQubes are capable 
   of performing various tasks, from Earth observation and amateur radio communications to scientific research and 
    technology demonstrations.

# Cubesat Basics:
## 🧑‍🚀 Introduction to CUBESAT : Basic concepts and processes
- [June 26: Cubesat101](https://github.com/silicon-sat/SI-2024-CubeSat/blob/main/docs/lectures/2024-0625-CubeSat101.pdf)

 - What is a cubesat?

   A CubeSat is a class of small satellite with a form factor of 10 cm (3.9 in) cubes. These tiny satellites have a 
   mass of no more than 2 kg (4.4 lb) per unit and often use commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components for their 
   electronics and structure. CubeSats are deployed into orbit from the International Space Station or launched as 
   secondary payloads on a launch vehicle. They’re employed for various purposes, including Earth observation, 
   testing new communications technology, and performing miniature experiments
  
- Why CUBESAT?
  
   CubeSats began as a collaborative effort in 1999 between Jordi Puig-Suari, a professor at California Polytechnic 
   State University (Cal Poly), and Bob Twiggs, a professor at Stanford University’s Space Systems Development 
   Laboratory (SSDL). The original intent of the project was to provide affordable access to space for the university 
   science community, and it has successfully done so. Now these are also used for various other experiments like testing instruments, enabling commercial applications,disaster response to climate monitoring.Supporting advanced mission concepts using constellations or swarms.

- Cubesat making procedure according to [NASA CubeSat-101 CSLI](https://www.bing.com/ck/a?!&&p=4d30e5cf239c36d9JmltdHM9MTcyMDU2OTYwMCZpZ3VpZD0yMTM2NjU1Yy00NTJhLTZkNWItMWNlOS03MWM4NDRmZjZjYjEmaW5zaWQ9NTIxMg&ptn=3&ver=2&hsh=3&fclid=2136655c-452a-6d5b-1ce9-71c844ff6cb1&psq=nasa+cubesat+pdf&u=a1aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmFzYS5nb3Yvd3AtY29udGVudC91cGxvYWRzLzIwMTcvMDMvbmFzYV9jc2xpX2N1YmVzYXRfMTAxXzUwOC5wZGY&ntb=1)

# Cubesat communication:
[June 26: CubeSat Communication I:](https://github.com/silicon-sat/SI-2024-CubeSat/blob/main/docs/lectures/2024-0626-CubeSat-Communication.pdf)

 ## Minimum payload
    -  The payload of a satellite refers to the part that gives it its primary function or purpose. Essentially, the 
      payload is what performs the specific tasks or functions desired from the satellite. For instance, in 
      communication satellites, the payload includes antennas, receivers, and transmitters that facilitate 
      communication.Given below is the minimal payload for a Cubesat.
      
      ![minimumpayload](https://github.com/AshritaSahoo/SIT-CUBESAT-AS/assets/174847576/3ebc7d27-b1f6-412e-ae19-192caabe2b92)

   - Here are the functions of the above shown parts.
     [FUNCTIONS](https://view.officeapps.live.com/op/view.aspx?src=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FAshritaSahoo%2FSIT-CUBESAT-AS%2Fmain%2FCUBESAT%2520PARTS%2520AND%2520FUNCTIONS.docx&wdOrigin=BROWSELINK)
   - In general minimum payload consists of a power management system, an on-board computer and a communication system.
       
 ## Basic digital modulation
   1. What is digital modulation? What are the basic bandpass types?
       (ASK,FSK,PSK)
       [Digital modulation](https://github.com/AshritaSahoo/SIT-CUBESAT-AS/blob/main/Digital%20Modulation.docx)
   2. Carrier frequency selection
        In telecommunications, carrier frequency refers to the frequency of a carrier wave—a periodic waveform, usually sinusoidal—that carries no information itself. Instead, it’s modified by an information-bearing signal (the modulation signal) to convey information. The carrier wave typically has a much higher frequency than the message signal. This is done to ensure propagation efficiency. The factors of selecting the carrier frequency are: Power efficiency, bandwidth efficieny, system complexity, frequency allocation and regulations.

- Satellite orbital Fundamentals
  Upon launch, a satellite or spacecraft is most often placed in one of several particular orbits around Earth – or it might be sent on an interplanetary journey, meaning that it does not orbit Earth anymore, but instead orbits the Sun until its arrival at its final destination. They are of the following types : LEO (Low Earth Orbit), MEO(Medium Earth Orbit), GEO(Geostationary Orbit). Here are is the information you need to know before selecting the orbit: [ESA-TYPES OF ORBITS](https://www.esa.int/Enabling_Support/Space_Transportation/Types_of_orbits)

 ## LoRa based communication system

 - LoRa (from "long range") is a physical proprietary radio communication technique. It is based on spread spectrum modulation techniques derived from chirp spread 
   spectrum (CSS) technology. It was developed by Cycleo, a company of Grenoble, France, and patented in 2014. Cycleo was later acquired by Semtech.
 -  Here is a brief information about LoRa provided by Semtech.[PDF](https://github.com/silicon-sat/SI-2024-CubeSat/blob/main/docs/AN1200_22_Semtech_LoRa_Basics_v2_STD.pdf)

![lora_archtct](https://github.com/AshritaSahoo/SIT-CUBESAT-AS/assets/174847576/c50f5b96-2edc-4804-ac7b-1214b8ddda79)

1. **Analog Front End & Data Conversion:**
   - **Matching:** This component ensures impedance matching between the antenna and the receiver.
   - **LNA (Low Noise Amplifier):** Amplifies weak incoming signals from the antenna.
   - **LPF (Low Pass Filter):** Filters out unwanted high-frequency noise.
   - **ADC (Analog to Digital Converter):** Converts analog signals to digital for further processing.

2. **LoRa™ Modem:**
   - Processes digital signals using LoRa technology for long-range communication.

3. **Protocol Engine:**
   - Manages communication protocols and data packet handling.

4. **FSK Modem:**
   - Handles Frequency Shift Keying modulation and demodulation.

5. **Power Management:**
   - **DC-DC Converter:** Regulates voltage levels.
   - **LDO (Low Dropout Regulator):** Provides stable power supply.

6. **SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface):**
   - Used for communication between microcontrollers and other devices.

7. **Data Buffer:**
   - Temporarily stores data during processing or transmission.

8. **PA (Power Amplifier), PLL (Phase-Locked Loop), and OSC (Oscillator):**
   - **PA:** Boosts signal strength before transmission.
   - **PLL:** Used in frequency synthesis and clock generation.
   - **OSC:** Generates periodic signals.

## ESP32
- The ESP32 is a versatile System on Chip (SoC) microcontroller developed by Espressif Systems. [ESP32 REFERENCE MANUAL](https://github.com/silicon-sat/SI-2024-CubeSat/blob/main/docs/Datasheet-ESP32.pdf)
- [ESP32 DATASHEET](https://github.com/silicon-sat/SI-2024-CubeSat/blob/main/docs/Datasheet-ESP32.pdf)
-  It is a microcontroller, with built-in wifi and bluetooth.
  
![ESP32](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bcd8925d-297e-4101-a7ee-f9ba505d663d)

It's pin configuration is as such:
![Screenshot_12-7-2024_85451_www espressif com](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/331ba15e-e958-48b3-9d13-7241ce9bf729)

- All those devices come together to form a communication system between the satellite(CubeSat) and the ground station consisting of the LoRa module and ESP32.

  ## SPI protocol
  - It is a synchronous communication protocol.
  - It allows a full duplex communication: i.e it can transmit and receive signals at the same time.
  -  SPI uses four wires:
     MOSI (Master Out, Slave In): Main (master) sends data to the sub (slave).
     MISO (Master In, Slave Out): Sub sends data to the main.
     SCLK (Serial Clock): Clock signal from the main.
     CS (Chip Select): Active-low signal to select a specific sub device.
