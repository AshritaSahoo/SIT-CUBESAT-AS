# üó£Ô∏è AN ENLIGHTENING TALK BY Dr. Chinmoy Saha 
 - He is a Professor at the Department of Avionics in the Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology.
 - The Talk was about Small form factor satellites and satellite communication.
 - A CubeSat is a class of small satellite with a form factor of 10 cm (3.9 in) cubes. These tiny satellites have a 
   mass of no more than 2 kg (4.4 lb) per unit and often use commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components for their 
   electronics and structure. CubeSats are deployed into orbit from the International Space Station or launched as 
   secondary payloads on a launch vehicle. They‚Äôre employed for various purposes, including Earth observation, 
   testing new communications technology, and performing miniature experiments

# üó£Ô∏è AN ADVENTUROUS JOURNEY WITH Harrish Kesavan:
- He is a core team member of To Space.
- The talk about Exploring pocket cube satellites gave off small satellites, big impact vibes.
- A PocketCube is a type of miniaturized satellite designed for space research. These tiny satellites typically have 
  a cube shape with 5 cm sides (one-eighth the volume of a CubeSat) and weigh no more than 250 grams. They often    
  use commercial off-the-shelf components for their electronics. Despite their small size, PocketQubes are capable 
   of performing various tasks, from Earth observation and amateur radio communications to scientific research and 
    technology demonstrations.

# Cubesat Basics:
## üßë‚ÄçüöÄ Introduction to CUBESAT : Basic concepts and processes

 - What is a cubesat?

   A CubeSat is a class of small satellite with a form factor of 10 cm (3.9 in) cubes. These tiny satellites have a 
   mass of no more than 2 kg (4.4 lb) per unit and often use commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components for their 
   electronics and structure. CubeSats are deployed into orbit from the International Space Station or launched as 
   secondary payloads on a launch vehicle. They‚Äôre employed for various purposes, including Earth observation, 
   testing new communications technology, and performing miniature experiments
  
- Why CUBESAT?
  
   CubeSats began as a collaborative effort in 1999 between Jordi Puig-Suari, a professor at California Polytechnic 
   State University (Cal Poly), and Bob Twiggs, a professor at Stanford University‚Äôs Space Systems Development 
   Laboratory (SSDL). The original intent of the project was to provide affordable access to space for the university 
   science community, and it has successfully done so.

- What is a dispenser?
  The dispenser is the interface between the CubeSat and the launch vehicle (LV). The dispenser provides attachment  
  to a launch vehicle (or rocket), protects the CubeSat during launch, and releases it into space at the appropriate 
  time.
