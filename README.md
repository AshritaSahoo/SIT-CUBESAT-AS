# Cubesat Basics:
## Introduction to CubeSat : Basic concepts and processes
 - What is a CubeSat?

   A CubeSat is a class of small satellite with a form factor of 10 cm (3.9 in) cubes. These tiny satellites have a 
   mass of no more than 2 kg (4.4 lb) per unit and often use commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components for their 
   electronics and structure. CubeSats are deployed into orbit from the International Space Station or launched as 
   secondary payloads on a launch vehicle. They‚Äôre employed for various purposes, including Earth observation, 
   testing new communications technology, and performing miniature experiments
  
- Why CubeSat?
  
   CubeSats began as a collaborative effort in 1999 between Jordi Puig-Suari, a professor at California Polytechnic 
   State University (Cal Poly), and Bob Twiggs, a professor at Stanford University‚Äôs Space Systems Development 
   Laboratory (SSDL). The original intent of the project was to provide affordable access to space for the university science community, and it has successfully done so. Now these are also used for various other experiments like testing instruments, enabling commercial applications,disaster response to climate monitoring.Supporting advanced mission concepts using constellations or swarms.

# Signal Processing
 ## Digital Modulation 
 - Basic digital modulation:
 1. What is digital modulation?
    
    Modulation is The process of superimposing high-frequency carrier signals with low-frequency message signals resulting in a modulated wave.  In modulation, one of the three parameters of the carrier wave is changed i.e. amplitude, frequency or phase according to the amplitude of the message signal at a given time instant. It is an important technique used to increase the range of communication, increase the signal-to-noise ratio, and decrease the size of the antenna. In this process the binary data is modulated to a carrier sinusoidal wave.

2. What are the basic digital modulation methods?
 
   i. Non-return to zero level:
    It represents binary 1 as a high voltage level (often positive) and binary 0 as a low voltage level (often zero). It maintains the signal level constant for the duration of the bit time.

![Screenshot-(311)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3e25349a-6f62-40ae-859c-becbc6567344)

   
   
   ii. Unipolar RZ:
   It represents binary 1 as a positive voltage (e.g., +V volts) and binary 0 represented by a zero voltage (0 volts). Return to zero- The signal returns to zero volts (or a reference voltage) at regular intervals, specifically at the midpoint of each bit period.

   ![Unipolar rz](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7f905a06-b4e3-4b02-9a18-d75628d51178)

  
   iii. Bi-phase-L (Manchester):
    There is a transition in the middle of each bit period, which allows for clock synchronization and improves reliability in noisy environments.Binary 1 is represented by a transition from a high to a low (or low to high) state in the middle of the bit period.Binary 0 is represented by a transition from a low to a high (or high to low) state in the middle of the bit period.

![Screenshot-(319)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e131921f-229b-4046-8d97-dd5c6f5d0939)




- Basic Bandpass Modulation

1. What is bandpass modulation?
     Bandpass modulation refers to a type of modulation where the baseband signal (which typically carries the information to be transmitted) is modulated onto a carrier signal. This process effectively shifts the frequency spectrum of the baseband signal to a higher frequency range, known as the passband.

2.What are the basic bandpass types? 
  i. Amplitude Shift Keying (ASK):
  Varies the amplitude of the carrier wave to represent binary data.
Binary 1 might be a high amplitude, while binary 0 might be a low or zero amplitude.

 ii. Frequency Shift Keying (FSK):
 Changes the frequency of the carrier wave to represent binary data.
Binary 1 could be a high frequency, and binary 0 could be a low frequency.

iii. Phase Shift Keying (PSK):
Alters the phase of the carrier wave to represent binary data.
Binary 1 and binary 0 are represented by different phase shifts (e.g. 0¬∞and 180¬∞ for Binary PSK).

![Screenshot_13-7-2024_72631_github com](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d63643db-6b46-4e50-a9f0-e39885d2be2b)

## Carrier Frequency Selection
- What is carrier signal?

    A carrier signal is a high-frequency signal that is modulated by the baseband signal. The carrier frequency is chosen such that it lies within a certain band of frequencies, known as the passband.
 
![OIP](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/14702ef0-008f-4a71-9810-8597eead46cb)


- Carrier frequency selection
        In telecommunications, carrier frequency refers to the frequency of a carrier wave‚Äîa periodic waveform, usually sinusoidal‚Äîthat carries no information itself. Instead, it‚Äôs modified by an information-bearing signal (the modulation signal) to convey information. The carrier wave typically has a much higher frequency than the message signal. This is done to ensure propagation efficiency. The factors of selecting the carrier frequency are:
  i. Power efficiency
  ii. bandwidth efficieny
  iii. system complexity
  iv. frequency allocation and regulations.
- The  CubeSats often use frequencies allocated for amateur satellites. These fall within the VHF(Very High Frequency) band (145.8 MHz ‚Äì 146.0 MHz) and the UHF(Ultra High Frequency) band (435.0 MHz ‚Äì 438.0 MHz).
- The choice of this frequency allows for relatively low-power communication, making it suitable for battery-operated devices like CubeSats. Additionally, it provides a long wireless ranExa- Hence we would be operating at 433MHz for this project.

  ## FFT
  - FFT analysis is one of the most used techniques when performing signal analysis across several application domains. FFT transforms signals from the time domain to the frequency domain. FFT is the abbreviation of Fast Fourier Transform.

Exam FFT analysis, numerous signal characteristics can be investigated to a much greater extent than when inspecting the time domain data. In the frequency domain, the signal characteristics are described by independent frequency components, wherein the time domain it is described by one waveform, containing the sum of all characteristics.

![freqtime-350x244](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9db5f2fb-8aa9-4fff-b6fb-a72d01a2c2c4)

## Bandwidth
- Bandwidth refers to the range of frequencies over which a signal, channel, or communication system can operate effectively. It represents the capacity for transmitting data within a given frequency range.
- In digital systems (e.g., internet connections), bandwidth affects data transfer rates. Higher bandwidth enables faster downloads and smoother streaming.
- Bandwidth is typically measured in hertz (Hz) or its multiples

## Bit Rate:
- Bit rate, also known as data rate, refers to the rate at which data is transmitted or processed.
It represents the number of bits (binary digits) transmitted per unit of time (usually seconds).

- Bit rate is typically measured in bits per second (bps) or its multiples

Exampat communication:
## Satellite orbital Fundamentals
  Upon launch, a satellite or spacecraft is most often placed in one of several particular orbits around Earth ‚Äì or it might be sent on an interplanetary journey, meaning that it does not orbit Earth anymore, but instead orbits the Sun until its arrival at its final destination. They are of the following types : LEO (Low Earth Orbit), MEO(Medium Earth Orbit), GEO(Geostationary Orbit). Here are is the information you need to know before selecting the orbit: [ESA-TYPES OF ORBITS](https://www.esa.int/Enabling_Support/Space_Transportation/Types_of_orbits)

  ![GEO-MEO-and-LEO-orbits](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ad9ad07e-69b8-4b91-b7d3-27c2ea38d93e)

- CubeSats primarily operate in LEO. This is beacause lower energy requirements simplify deployment, LEO provides better communication coverage due to proximity to ground stations and CubeSats can transmit data more efficiently at shorter distances.
  
 ## Minimal payload (An example) 
   -  The payload of a satellite refers to the part that gives it its primary function or purpose. Essentially, the payload is what performs the specific tasks or functions desired from the satellite. For instance, in communication satellites, the payload includes antennas, receivers, and transmitters that facilitates communication.Given below is the minimal payload for a Cubesat.
      
   ![minimumpayload](https://github.com/AshritaSahoo/SIT-CUBESAT-AS/assets/174847576/3ebc7d27-b1f6-412e-ae19-192caabe2b92)

   - Here are the functions of the above shown parts.

## CubeSat Architecture (An example) 

![Cubesat architecture](https://github.com/AshritaSahoo/SIT-CUBESAT-AS/assets/174847576/4f5c2992-2749-4cb4-93ea-7d2e4c85b45a)

 ## LoRa based communication system

 - LoRa (from "long range") is a physical proprietary radio communication technique. It is based on spread spectrum modulation techniques derived from chirp spread 
   spectrum (CSS) technology. It was developed by Cycleo, a company of Grenoble, France, and patented in 2014. Cycleo was later acquired by Semtech.
 -  Here is a brief information about LoRa provided by Semtech.[PDF](https://github.com/silicon-sat/SI-2024-CubeSat/blob/main/docs/AN1200_22_Semtech_LoRa_Basics_v2_STD.pdf)
### Spread Spectrum Principle
- Spread spectrum refers to a technique used in telecommunications and signal processing to spread the bandwidth of a signal over a much wider range than the minimum necessary for transmission.

  ![download2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5930ed3c-5fe9-480f-a524-ac1f5c71f291)

- Spreading factor:
  The spreading factor is a critical parameter in LoRa-based communication systems.LoRa uses Chirp Spread Spectrum (CSS) technology, where chirps (symbols) carry data. The spreading factor controls the chirp rate, which, in turn, affects the speed of data transmission.
  ![download3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/17891ea6-80d0-4311-ad34-9c980174d388)

### SNR(Signal to Noise Ratio) and RSSI (Received signal strangth Indicator)
- SNR is the ratio of the signal power to the noise power. A higher SNR indicates a stronger signal relative to noise, leading to better communication quality.
- RSSI is a measurement of how well your device can hear a signal from an access point or router. The greater the RSSI value, the stronger the signal.
- For SNR>0: RSSI or Packet Strength (dBm)= -164+RSSI
- For SNR<0: RSSI= -164+ PacketRSSI+0.25*PacketSNR

### Properties of LoRa:

![LoRa](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/34634962-4c3d-47c8-99e1-6c7914efd861)

## ESP32
- The ESP32 is a versatile System on Chip (SoC) microcontroller developed by Espressif Systems. [ESP32 REFERENCE MANUAL](https://github.com/silicon-sat/SI-2024-CubeSat/blob/main/docs/Datasheet-ESP32.pdf)
- [ESP32 DATASHEET](https://github.com/silicon-sat/SI-2024-CubeSat/blob/main/docs/Datasheet-ESP32.pdf)
-  It is a microcontroller, with built-in wifi and bluetooth, it features a dual-core processor, extensive GPIO (General-Purpose Input/Output) pins, and support for various peripherals.
-  These are also widely used in IoT applications.
-   The ESP32's versatility is enhanced by its compatibility with popular development environments like the Arduino IDE and Espressif's own ESP-IDF. In this program, further on, we use the Arduino IDE for various experiments on ESP32.
  
![ESP32](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bcd8925d-297e-4101-a7ee-f9ba505d663d)

  ## SPI protocol (Serial Peripheral Interface)
  - It is a synchronous communication protocol. SPI is a fast, efficient protocol for communication between a master device and multiple slaves, commonly used in microcontroller-based projects for interfacing with peripherals like sensors, displays, and memory devices. Understanding SPI is crucial for developing embedded systems that require reliable, high-speed data transfer.
  - It allows a full duplex communication: i.e it can transmit and receive signals at the same time.
  -  SPI uses four wires:
     MOSI (Master Out, Slave In): Main (master) sends data to the sub (slave).
     MISO (Master In, Slave Out): Sub sends data to the main.
     SCLK (Serial Clock): Clock signal from the main.
     CS (Chip Select): Active-low signal to select a specific sub device.
 - Every device connected requires a wire of its own.
 - Working od SPI:
   Initialization: The master configures the clock speed and selects the slave by pulling the Chip Select line low.
   Data Transfer: Data is shifted out of the master to the slave via MOSI, while data from the slave is shifted into the master via MISO, synchronized by the clock.
   End Communication: The master deselects the slave by pulling the Chip Select line high.

![SPI ACCESS](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/41679ba7-34e9-4690-a8ac-cb47e000419a)

## Communication process
 - All those devices come together to form a communication system between the satellite(CubeSat) and the ground station consisting of the LoRa module and ESP32.
   
![Screenshot_6-7-2024_95120_github com](https://github.com/AshritaSahoo/SIT-CUBESAT-AS/assets/174847576/48737ce6-c15b-4b47-a4f0-5b8680d6b9f1)

- The CubeSat collects data (telemetry or payload) and prepares it for transmission. Then its on board computer sends/ transmits data and communicates wirelessly with the LoRa RF module.The frequemcy at which the CubeSat sends the signal is 433MHz and so the ground station is designed in accordance with that to receive the signals, with a coverage of 110 degrees.
- The ESP32 Dev kit is connected to the LoRa RF module via SPI and uploads the data to the internet with WiFi.
- This data can be extracted from the Tiny GS website which is an open-source global satellite network that empowers space enthusiasts to become pioneers.

# Introduction to VLSI
- VLSI  stands for Very-Large-Scale Integration, a process of creating integrated circuits by combining thousands to millions of transistors onto a single chip. It revolutionized the field of electronics by making devices smaller, faster, and more energy-efficient. VLSI technology is the foundation for modern microprocessors, memory chips, and other complex integrated circuits used in a wide range of applications, from consumer electronics to advanced computing systems.

# CONCEPT OF ANTENNAS
- An antenna is a device used to transmit and receive electromagnetic waves. It is a critical component in communication systems, enabling the transmission of data over distances without the need for physical connections. Antennas operate based on the principle of electromagnetic wave propagation. When a current flows through the antenna, it generates an electromagnetic field that radiates outwards. Conversely, when electromagnetic waves impinge on the antenna, they induce a current that can be detected and processed by the receiver.

## Types of Antennas
 - Wire Antennas

## Radiation Pattern
- The radiation pattern of an antenna describes how the antenna radiates energy into space or receives energy from space. It is a graphical representation of the distribution of power radiated by the antenna as a function of direction. The formation of the radiation pattern is influenced by several factors, including the antenna's physical structure, the current distribution along the antenna elements, and the operating frequency.

## Polarization
- It is the orientation of the electric field of the radiated electromagnetic wave. It is a key parameter in antenna design and communication systems, as it affects how antennas transmit and receive signals. The polarization of an antenna must match the polarization of the incoming or outgoing signals for optimal performance.

## Antenna tuning
- Tuning an antenna involves adjusting its physical parameters or electronic components to ensure it resonates at the desired frequency or frequencies, providing optimal performance for transmitting and receiving signals. Proper tuning minimizes impedance mismatch, maximizes signal strength, and reduces standing wave ratio (SWR).

   - [LED DATASHEET](https://github.com/silicon-sat/SI-2024-CubeSat/blob/main/docs/Datasheet-LED-XLMR01DE.pdf)

      1. For LED:
       
      | Parameters | Values |
      | ---------- | ----------------------------------------- |
      | Maximum Forward current (If) | 20mA |
      | Typical forward voltage (Vf)| 1.85V |
      | Dominant wavelength | 640nm |
      | Color (RGB) from dominant wavelength | Red |
      | Typical capacitance | 45pF |
      | Operating temperature range | -25 to 50 degree Celcius |

      2. For ESP32:

     | Parametera | Values |
     | ---------- | ------ |
     | Maximum output voltage of GPIO pins | 3.3V |
     | Maximum current that GPIO can source from supply to load | 40mA |
     | Resistance in the circuit | 105 Ohms |

Write a program to control the LED intensity using Pulse-Width Modulation (PWM).


# Lab 4: Dimming multiple LEDs

ESP32 GPIO pins were used to dim multiiple LEDs with different delays.
# Lab 5: Printing data in the serial monitor

The Serial Monitor is an essential tool when creating projects with Arduino. It can be used as a debugging tool, testing concepts, or communicating directly with the Arduino board.
The Arduino IDE 2 has the Serial Monitor tool integrated with the editor, which means that no external window is opened when using the Serial Monitor. This means that you can have multiple windows open, each with its own Serial Monitor.

# Lab 6: Controlling an LED through serial monitor

Controlling an LED connected to ESP32 by reading commands from the serial monitor and turning the LED on or off based on those commands.
